2020-04-01 09:04:19,"Hi @Anna Demianik @Serhii Shevchyk :slightly_smiling_face:
1. In the background of the ""MEG going on maintenance mode on live on 18.03.2020"" incident, we have decided that updates team should not interact with LIVE environments at any level. We should only update dev, QA and Stage and then hand it over to SRE to deploy on Live. Update the ticket and assign to me so that I can schedule it. I hope it works for you. If you need Live DB always request from SRE and we will provide you that. Please confirm that you commit to this.
2. Probably we should also re-think if we really need Live DB always for all projects especially the ones where we have active development going on and some of those keep refreshing their dev/stage from Live. So only request where it's really needed.
3. For projects where active development is going on (BMW, MINI, Carfax, UBM and so many others) and some of them are really critical from the view point of their business value as well as time-bound sprints going on, we need to be very very very careful and update dev, QA, Stage also in coordination with the project team. So we need to work on a plan here to tackle these projects and we need to work in close coordination with the project team. Lets finish the other projects first and get to these active ones only at the end once we have a better plan.

So it's best to give people both repo-urls and have them check the one with the newest commits and work with that.

In case of amazee it's telling them ""please add the following key on all our projects"".
On AWS/CFT-Projects I think the sysadmin/SRE-Team has to add the key to a file on S3 and the server...
On Freistil the SRE-Team has to add the key using the UI of Freistil to each project running on there
On Platform.sh the SRE-Team has to add the key using the UI of Platform.sh to each project running on there
On ""just server hosting"" the SRE-Team has to connect to each server individually and add the key.

2020-02-18 10:15:54,"There are many ways to find out what needs updating.
The easiest but most dangerous way would be to just update everything with composer (`composer update`). That will most probably break stuff in most of our projects right now, as the version-jumps are big.
With a bit more effort one can check what modules have security updates available (`drush up`) and only update those with composer. This will not break as much, as we're only updating few selected modules. But composer might still cause issues with dependencies and stuff.
Another way is to check in the drupal-backend what updates are availabe. Will give the same output as `drush up` though.

With Drupal 7 projects there is no composer (mostly... there was that one project... dualesstudiumhessen?). So here you'll have to do `drush up` and update the modules manually. Not sure, but maybe `drush up` even has an option to only do security updates.",serkan

2020-02-17 14:09:26,"yes. generally: all the projects are bit different. Between Drupal 7 and 8 there are the obvious differences, but there are also subtle differences between projects of the same version.
Best is to have someone who was involved in the development to talk to (or have the documentation be perfect)",serkan
2020-02-17 14:10:14,For the first project to update I wouldn't suggest RUB... but maybe MEG or some other D8 project that isn't too big :smile:,serkan
