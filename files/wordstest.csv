08/19/19 08:32 AM,@sebastian idk,Julia  
08/19/19 08:34 AM,@sebastian I'm only two days in the office,Julia  
03/09/20 04:13 PM,Depending on what the amazee-file has,Margaret
03/13/20 12:36 PM,i suspect they're dead as well,Margaret
03/13/20 12:39 PM,well,Margaret
03/13/20 01:00 PM,nope,Margaret
03/05/20 12:57 PM,But if you guys say so,Margaret
03/05/20 12:57 PM,just let me tell ya: If you wanna update Konsumgoettinnen,Margaret
08/27/19 11:20 AM,I don't really like that Idea. We should at least have some sort of stage where the customer can test his stuff. If he doesn't,Margaret
08/27/19 11:48 AM,I did update project,Margaret
03/03/20 11:36 AM,Database... Yeah. Either via ssh,Margaret
03/03/20 12:45 PM,okay,Margaret
03/03/20 01:38 PM,nice. anywhere other people can access that as well? so I don't need to write down twice,Margaret
02/18/20 10:18 AM,If any other questions come up,Margaret
03/19/20 10:28 AM,The real question is if you installed backup_migrate... if you did that,Margaret
03/19/20 10:31 AM,well there we go :smile: @Miguel you tell nico,Margaret
02/17/20 02:04 PM,Guess who's back! yes,Margaret
08/19/19 08:41 AM,If we do the updates continuously,Margaret
08/19/19 08:47 AM,But you're right. All those communication stuff after the update,Margaret
03/11/20 01:14 PM,Right,Margaret
03/11/20 01:28 PM,For that I guess the development-team has to tell the devops team where to check that,Margaret
03/11/20 02:03 PM,@Don you checked in the repo,Margaret
03/10/20 12:12 PM,nope,Margaret
04/01/20 11:31 AM,yes,Miguel

05/12/20 12:12 PM,there is custom server for that,Miguel
05/13/20 12:53 PM,it will take me some time,Miguel
03/31/20 03:03 PM,request devops to do it,Miguel
05/18/20 09:10 AM,yes,Miguel

04/28/20 03:25 PM,@Sarah if the project is in Amazee legacy but no updates instance present,Paul
04/28/20 03:37 PM,@Bobby Is this for LWB ? Its already in progress,Paul

05/08/20 01:51 AM,@Barry @Anna  @Sarah we have a list of projects hosted on Amazee that are using dblog module and Amazee is asking to switch to lagoon_logs,Richard
03/31/20 09:27 AM,If you say that your changes didnât get on the server,Richard
03/31/20 09:32 AM,try to push an empty commit to dev now,Richard
03/31/20 01:06 PM,I asked amazee support team,Richard
03/31/20 02:26 PM,@Sarah how should we manage these kind of requests,Richard
03/31/20 02:26 PM,also thereâs another issue with a project from @Anna that needs someone to look at,Richard
03/25/20 07:22 PM,@Anna ok,Sarah

03/13/20 12:56 PM,ok,Sarah
03/13/20 12:59 PM,then it's a good idea and you can include it in your list. If there is any ticket,Sarah
03/13/20 01:58 PM,@Anna You need to leave both of these projects for now until we have their Dev,Sarah
03/13/20 02:07 PM,ok,Sarah
03/05/20 12:49 PM,@Anna Estimation is good to proceed,Sarah
