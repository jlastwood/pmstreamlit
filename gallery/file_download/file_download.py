    There is currently (20191204) no official way of downloading data from Streamlit.

    But I discovered a workaround
    [here](https://github.com/holoviz/panel/issues/839#issuecomment-561538340).

    It's based on the concept of
    [HTML Data URLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs)

    You can try it out below for a dataframe csv file download.

    The methodology can be extended to other file types. For inspiration see
