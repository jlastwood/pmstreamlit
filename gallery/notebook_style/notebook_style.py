"""
This file implements a function you can use to make Streamlit output more Notebook like

The functionally was developed by [David Chudzicki](https://github.com/dchudz). See

- [Announcement]\
(https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/implementation-of-end-code-block-using-streamlit-for-notebook/1505)
- [Repo](https://github.com/dchudz/streamlit_end_code_block)

Here we have modified it for inclusion in the gallery at awesome-streamlit.org.
