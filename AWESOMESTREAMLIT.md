# Awesome Streamlit

## Introduction

We believe that [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is truly awesome.

Streamlit is announced as being **The fastest way to build custom ML tool** but we believe it's **much more awesome** than that.

The best way to think about the arrival of Streamlit is to think of the arrival of the Iphone that replaced the calls and sms's of the original mobile phone with powerfull computing and apps. We can see that in now but not when it was announced.

So it's too early tell how Awesome Streamlit will be. Maybe it's the Iphone of Data Science, Web Apps, Code, or Python. The future will determine.

This article will discuss the potential of Streamlit and was inspired questions to this [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcskovmadsen_turn-python-scripts-into-beautiful-ml-tools-activity-6585883899514146816-OonG) on LinkedIn.
