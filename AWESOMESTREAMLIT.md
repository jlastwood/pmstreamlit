# Awesome Streamlit

## Introduction

This article will discuss how awesome [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is.

We believe that Streamlit is truly awesome.

Streamlit is announced as being **[The fastest way to build custom ML tool](https://towardsdatascience.com/coding-ml-tools-like-you-code-ml-models-ddba3357eace)** but we believe it's **much more awesome** than that.

The best way to think about the arrival of Streamlit is to think of the arrival of the Iphone that replaced the calls and sms's of the original mobile phone with powerfull computing and ecosystem of apps. We can see that now but not when it was announced.

Streamlit has just arrived (Oct 2019). So it's too early tell how Awesome Streamlit will be. But we see the **potential to become the Iphone of Data Science, Web Apps, Code, or Python**.

This article was inspired by questions to this [post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcskovmadsen_turn-python-scripts-into-beautiful-ml-tools-activity-6585883899514146816-OonG).
