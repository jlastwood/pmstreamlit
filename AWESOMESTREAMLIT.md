# Awesome Streamlit [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/awesome-streamlit)

## Introduction

This article will discuss if [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is awesome and how awesome it can be.

Streamlit is announced as being **[The fastest way to build custom ML tool](https://towardsdatascience.com/coding-ml-tools-like-you-code-ml-models-ddba3357eace)** but we believe it has the potential to become **much more awesome** than that.

The best way to think about the arrival of Streamlit is to think of the **arrival of the Iphone** being announced as **the smartest way to place calls and send text messages**. Well yes :-). But now we can see that it's a powerfull compute engine and an ecosystem of apps that has changed peoples lifes.

Streamlit has just arrived (Oct 2019). So it's too early tell if Streamlit will become truly awesome.

But we see the **potential to become the Iphone of Data Science, Technical Writing, Web Apps, Code, Python and more**. It has the potential to change the way we share knowledge and create tools and applications because it's so plain simple to use.

This article was inspired by a reply in this [post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcskovmadsen_turn-python-scripts-into-beautiful-ml-tools-activity-6585883899514146816-OonG) and some replies to the announcement in the [Streamlit Community](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/streamlit-has-launched/105/5).

## Disclaimer

THE BELOW IS VERY PRELIMINARY AND RAPIDLY DEVELOPING! IT'S A VISION. NOT FACTS!

## Data Science

Data Science is a very broad category. It's used for to categorize work such as

- data transformations and visualisations in excel
- interactive data visualisations in BI Tools like Power BI and Tableau
- Building Fundamental, Statistical, Mathematical, Machine Learning or Deeplearning models in Python, R etc.
- Building applications on top of data science models and deploying them to production using web frameworks such as Bokeh/ Dash, Flask/ Django and React/Vue/Angular.

and much more

But actually every body extracting, transforming, loading and presenting data are actually doing work very similar to data scientists. If they are very structured about it and using methodologies from software development they are called Data Engineers, ML Engineers or Platform Engineers :-)

### Notebooks

#### Situation

One of the revolutionary tools of modern data science is the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

[![Awesome](https://jupyter.org/assets/jupyterpreview.png)](https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/awesome-streamlit)

The jupyter notebook provides an environment for working very exploratory and visually within data science

#### Problem

A jupyter notebook cannot really be deployed directly to production and the users.

So Notebooks do not facilitate rapid sharing, exploration, testing and improvement cycle you would like.

Bottom line. Notebooks are costly.

#### Complication

The pains of the Jupyter Notebook are

- The Notebook is not as productive a development environment as an Editor or IDE.
- The Notebook workflow tends to lead to code that is poorly written and/ or is difficult to reproduce.
- The Notebook cannot really be deployed to production and shared with users as an application. You can distribute it as pdf or html. But most often it will be refactored into a code library or an application by a team of developers.
- for more see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U) video by Guss Allen.

Jupyter has tried to develop a more productive development environment called [Jupyter Labs](https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-lab-evolution-of-the-jupyter-notebook-5297cacde6b).

But this environment also has it's pains.

- It's still not as productive or extensible as a real editor like VS Code or Pycharm.
- It changes the Notebook from being a simple interactive document that you can read and distribute as pdf or html to an advanced but complicated development environment that you work in.

#### Solution

Streamlit aims to solve all of the problems described above as described in the  [Announcement](https://towardsdatascience.com/coding-ml-tools-like-you-code-ml-models-ddba3357eace).

[![Streamlit Video](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*p3XPm-x0TUIuMmQQa4mjHQ.gif)](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*p3XPm-x0TUIuMmQQa4mjHQ.gif)

As you can see on the image above it simplifies everything by enabling data scientist to

- develop applications in just one python file (left side of image)
- using their editor of choice (VS Code on left side of image)
- producing a web application that can very easily be deployed to production. (right side of image)

And the application can provide the interactivity that you would normally be developing using a modern web framework as React, Vue or Angular. So one man can do it. **No team required**.

Streamlit provides **self service data science**.

And it's **very appealing to data scientists** as they can develop an application in the way they find simple, productive and joyfull

- Text as MarkDown
- Code in Python
- All of your data science modelling libraries at hand like Pandas, SciKitLearn, PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow etc.
- All of your data science visualisation libraries at hand like  Matplotlib, Vega and Plotly.
- No HTML and No Javascript is required.

We believe that the **Jupyter Notebook is the cell phone** and **Streamlit is the Iphone**.

#### Disclaimer

Streamlit is very new. There will be rough edges and things you cannot yet do. But as the principles and api of Streamlit is so simple and productive we believe they will be developed very rapidly.

Things you cannot do yet

- Select from thousands of web components to make your application interactive.
  - The basic ones are there
- Deploy to production with one click.
  - It can be deployed as any other python web application. And it's only one file, the streamlit package and any data science packages needed. So it's very simple to deploy.
