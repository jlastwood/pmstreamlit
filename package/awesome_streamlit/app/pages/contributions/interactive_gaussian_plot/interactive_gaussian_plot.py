# Interactive Gaussian Plot

## Introduction

This example is a Streamlit implementation of an interactive Gaussian plot.

The purpose of this example is to test what we can do and cannot (yet) do in Streamlit compared
to the combination of [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and [Voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila).


As of today (2019-10-20) both Voila and Streamlit are released for Beta Testing only.

## Findings

### Pros of Voila

- The plot **updates very, very fast** when the user changes the mu and sigma settings
- **Well tested slider** widget
- **Layout options** like HBox and VBox.
- The **plot stays in the same position** when moving the sliders.

### Pros of Streamlit

- You can use your **editor of choice**
  - Streamlit does not require knowing something like how to install and use a notebook editor.
  - You you can use integrated, automatic tests like pylint, mypy etc. to help  produce quality code.
- Very fast and **simple development cycle** of develop-test-refactor
because of very fast, automatic hot reload and ease of navigation in editor.
- End result is a **code file** that works very well with Git.
- End result comes with a **multiuser, production ready server** out of the box.

### Issues

Both Streamlit and Jupyter Notebook crashed during development

- Streamlit:
  - [Matplotlib Crash issue 469](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/469)
  - [Slider issue 470](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/470)
  - [No Grid issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+grid)
